Package: new808coind
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 New808coin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
 is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or
 trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
 transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to
 check for double-spending.
 .
 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.  This
 requires 1+ GB of space, slowly growing.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, new808coind, and the CLI tool
 new808coin-cli to interact with the daemon.

Package: new808coin-qt
Architecture: any

Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - Qt GUI
 New808coin (N808) is a sustainable cryptocurrency modeled after
 Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s vision for Bitcoin.
 It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer transactional currency designed
 to offer a solution to the problem posed by the exponential increase
 in energy consumed by Bitcoin and other proof-of-work currencies.
 Proof-of-work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the
 electricity used by high-powered mining hardware. New808coin
 utilizes an en- ergy efficient proof-of-stake algorithm, can be
 mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining
 equipment. The Green Protocol offers a simple solution to
 Bitcoin sustainability issues and provides a faster, more scalable
 blockchain that is better suited for daily transactional use.
 .
 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.  This
 requires 1+ GB of space, slowly growing.
 .
 This package provides New808coin-Qt, a GUI for New808coin based on Qt.
